# Matrix Encryption Encoder & Decoder

A Python-based encryption and decryption tool that uses linear algebra principles  
(matrix multiplication and modular arithmetic) to encode and decode messages.  
This project is educational and showcases how matrix-based ciphers can be applied in practice.

## 🔐 Features
- Encode plain text messages into encrypted numerical codes
- Decode encrypted numerical sequences back to human-readable messages
- Uses 2x2 or 3x3 square matrices for transformations
- Ensures the matrix used is valid (determinant coprime with 26)
- Padding for message blocks and modular operations for alphabet wrapping

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy (for matrix operations)
- Basic math (GCD, modular inverse, determinant checking)

## 📦 How to Run
1. Run the script using Python:
